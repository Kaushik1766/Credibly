## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

### IDEAL:
Learners who consume educational content on YouTube do not currently have a way to validate or showcase their learning. There‚Äôs a need for a system where they can not only follow along with content but also take assessments and receive verifiable certificates.

### REALITY:
Many learners acquire valuable skills from YouTube, but they have no formal recognition for their efforts. YouTube content creators, especially those teaching technical or academic subjects, have no easy way to offer structured courses or assessments.

### CONSEQUENCES:
Without a way to validate learning, YouTube learners are unable to prove their skills in formal environments, such as job applications or academic settings. Creators, too, are missing opportunities to monetize structured courses or offer added value to their audience.

## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

Credibily is a platform for YouTube creators who teach and want to offer their audience a way to validate their learning. Creators can log in using their Google account, select the video they want to create a course for, fill in details like descriptions, tags, and assessments. 

For now, Credibily supports AI-generated quizzes, but in the future, we will add project-based evaluations via GitHub and peer-to-peer reviews. Once the creator completes the course creation, a unique link is generated, which can be added to the YouTube video description. Viewers can follow the link, take the AI-generated quiz, and if they pass the set criteria, they can mint a certificate to showcase their learning.

---

## ‚õìÔ∏è Dependencies / Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>

- **Quiz Method Feasibility**: While the quiz method works well, not all learning types may fit a multiple-choice format.
- **Monetary Benefits**: Needs further discussion on how creators can monetize and the impact on user affordability.
- **Gmail Requirement**: Users and creators must log in with Google accounts, and videos must have transcripts uploaded.
- **Quiz Types**: Currently only supporting quizzes, but project-based evaluations and peer assessments will come in the future.

---

## üöÄ Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

- **Project-based evaluations**: Integration with GitHub for submitting projects and validating learning through code.
- **Peer-to-peer assessments**: Learners evaluating each other‚Äôs projects for greater engagement.
- **Expanded assessment types**: Add variety to the current quizzes by introducing case studies, subjective questions, etc.
- **Additional blockchain integration**: Beyond certificates, exploring how to tokenize course achievements and build creator economies.
